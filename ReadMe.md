# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview

This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** built using **Streamlit** and **Python**. The system uses a collaborative filtering approach to recommend movies based on the input movie title. It leverages a pre-trained similarity model (`similarity.pkl`) that calculates movie similarities to provide personalized recommendations. The app is deployed on **Streamlit** for easy access through a web interface.

The model is trained using a dataset of 5000 movies from **The Movie Database (TMDb)**, which includes movie titles, genres, and other metadata. 

You can interact with the live version of the system here: [Movie Recommendation System - Streamlit App](https://movie-recommendation-system-h3g77ainsgbabrawzp2x52.streamlit.app/).
